# CSS `calc()` Unit Mismatch
This example demonstrates a subtle but common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The problem arises from omitting units within the calculation, leading to unexpected behavior.

**bug.css** shows the incorrect usage.  **bugSolution.css** provides the correct implementation.

This is a good example of a less obvious error that can be difficult to debug without a close inspection of the CSS.
